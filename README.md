  Make Directed Graphs construction and manipulation easy, including cycle 
  dependency detection and graph traversal.

  **digraph-js** is a lightweight library allowing you to create a directed graph structure with embedded features such as cycle dependency detection 
  and graph introspection (finding ancestors and successors for any given vertices).
  It can be used to model your underlying system (can be a filesystem or simply objects)
  as a graph.

  ## Installation

  ```bash
  $ npm install digraph-js
  ```

  ## How to use it

  ```js
  import { DiGraph } from 'digraph-js';
  import assert from "node:assert";

  const myGraph = new DiGraph();

  const myDependencyA = { id: "dependencyA", adjacentTo: [], payload: {} };
  const myDependencyB = { id: "dependencyB", adjacentTo: [], payload: {} };

  // Add vertices to the graph
  myGraph.addVertices(myDependencyA, myDependencyB);

  // Link graph vertices: A ---> B link created
  myGraph.addEdge({ from: myDependencyA, to: myDependencyB });

  // Detect cycles (A ---> B and B ---> A)
  myGraph.addEdge({ from: myDependencyB, to: myDependencyA });

  assert.equal(myGraph.isAcyclic, false);
  assert.deepEqual(myGraph.findCycles().cycles, [ ["dependencyB", "dependencyA"] ]);
  ```

  
  ## You already manipulate Directed Graphs without knowing it

  Take for instance the image above with four Vertices each representing a 
  JavaScript file.

  Now the question is: what are the **relationships** between these files? In all 
  programming languages, one file might import one or multiple files. Whenever
  a file imports another one, an implicit relationship is created. 

  ***hello.js***
  ```js
  export function sayHello() { }
  ```

  ***main.js***
  ```js
  import { sayHello } from "hello.js";
  ```

  As you can see above, **main.js** imports **hello.js** to use the ```sayHello```
  function. The static import creates an implicit relationship between both files.
  In the fields of graphs, this relationship can be modeled as a directed edge 
  from **main.js** to **hello.js** (can be written as **main.js ---> hello.js**)
  We can also say that main.js **depends on** hello.js.

  We can update the graph with our edges represented:

  Basically this graph says that:
  - FileA directly depends on FileD and FileB
  - FileA indirectly depends on FileC (through both FileD and FileB)
  - FileD directly depends on FileC
  - FileB directly depends on FileC
  - FileC directly depends on nothing

  This structure may seem simple but can in fact be used to model very complex
  schemas such as:
  - ***Static dependencies analysis*** such as cycle dependencies detection
  (e.g: [ESLint no-cycle plugin](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/docs/rules/no-cycle.md))
  - ***Incremental/Affected tasks*** Bundlers/Monorepos tools make extensive use of it (e.g: [NX's affected build/test/lint...](https://nx.dev/using-nx/affected))
  - ***Task orchestration*** using a directed acyclic graph, parallel vs sequential 
  computations can be modeled (e.g: Continuous Integration schemas with stages, jobs, tasks)

  ## Further exploring with examples which recreate common features:
  - [affected builds (NX alike)](https://github.com/antoine-coulon/digraph-js/tree/master/examples/affected-builds)
  - [detect cyclic imports (eslint-plugin-import alike)](https://github.com/antoine-coulon/digraph-js/tree/master/examples/circular-dependencies)
  - Sequential vs Parallel execution => Work in progress
